Bit flip

Puzzle game?
Flip individual bits


Combat where you shoot cosmic rays at robots to mess with their code?
like the mutant dna idea

each robot has a set of skills, active and passive
shoot a ray at a skill to change it into something random

gain multiple rays per turn for more influence
nah gain 1

turn structure:
each robot gets one action
use cosmic rays at any point to flip bits

3 vs 3

maybe robots dont have hp, instead goal is to deal the most damage to the center core
or fight each other, limited revives, but on revive you get to reprogram

gain a bank of skills that can be used on revive


status (apply to skill):
mutant: skill flips after use/triggering
lockdown: skill can't flip
firewall: cant be inflicted with a status
null pointer: when a skill is used, chance for it to pick a random skill
buffer overflow: when a status is applied to this, apply it to every status
infinte loop: only this skill can be used once used or until flipped
virus: another random skill becomes this skill at end of turn
overclock: next skill is used twice, then this turns into burn
++: gains +1 value at end of turn
race condition: this skill may be used instead of another one
syntax error: this skill has no effect
