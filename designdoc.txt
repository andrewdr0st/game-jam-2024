Bit flip

Puzzle game?
Flip individual bits


Combat where you shoot cosmic rays at robots to mess with their code?
like the mutant dna idea

each robot has a set of skills, active and passive
shoot a ray at a skill to change it into something random

gain multiple rays per turn for more influence
nah gain 1

turn structure:
each robot gets one action
use cosmic rays at any point to flip bits

3 vs 3

maybe robots dont have hp, instead goal is to deal the most damage to the center core
or fight each other, limited revives, but on revive you get to reprogram

gain a bank of skills that can be used on revive


status (apply to skill):
lockdown: skill can't flip
firewall: cant be inflicted with a status
null pointer: when a skill is used, 50% chance for it to fail
buffer overflow: when a status is applied to this, apply it to every status
infinte loop: when used or triggered, repalce other skills with this
++: gains +1 value at end of turn
syntax error: this skill has no effect



skills:
freeze ray: deal small damage, apply lockdown
gamma ray: deal small damage and gain a cosmic ray
focus light: gain 2 cosmic ray
rush: deal damage and gain power
flamethrower: deal damage and apply burn to self and target
reboot: flip all skills and heal slightly
defender: gain hp and apply firewall
void beam: deal damage, afflict null pointer
overheat: damage all enemies, gain burn
burn: take damage at end of turn
fat laser: big damage, will buffer overflow
increment: apply ++ to a random skill
retaliate: deal damage, +1 power after taking damage
goto: skill gains +1 value, if it is a process, trigger it
corruption: lose a small amount of hp, apply syntax error
overclock: replace this with burn and apply ++ to all skills
demolisher: deal massive damage but self-apply syntax error to all skills
refactor: end of turn heal and remove nullpointer/syntax error
